## Bookshare

Bookshare is an innovative web platform in which you can upload your current books and eventually exchange them with other users

### Project structure

The client side consists of different react components distributed in pages (which are also components ðŸ˜ƒ). Each page corresponds to a different route, set up in the Navigation.js file. The client actively communicates with the backend through HTTP requests. You can access the rest api here: https://github.com/GeorgiArn/BookshareRestApi
